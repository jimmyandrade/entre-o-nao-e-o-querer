In my life there's still lie
Believin' that you'll come back
As if I could bring you back
To this place, right now

In this world I yearn for
I'm doing it all over again
And I part my life
Using begins and ends

You're so far
You're far away from reality
But it seems more as if you were here
You're lost among some galaxy and me...

And I know you're not happy
With the life you're living there

I'm looking to the stars and maybe they'll show
Tryin' to forget you but I don't know how
It is painful to know that you're far away from Earth
But I know: Milky Way will be my way to you.
