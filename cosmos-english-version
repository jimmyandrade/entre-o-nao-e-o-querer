In my life, I still lie
Believin' that you'll come back
Like I just could bring you back
To this place right now

In this world, I'm looking forward
And doin' it all again
And I part my life
From the beginnin' and end

You're so far
You're far away from reality
But it seems to be like you were here
You're just lost in some galaxy and me...

I know that you're not happy
With the life you're living there

I'm looking to the stars and maybe they'll show
Tryin' to forget you but I don't know how
Painful to know that you're far away from Earth
But I know... Milky Way. It's gonna be my way to you
